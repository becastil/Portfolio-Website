# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an interactive background overlay for the hero section that creates a dynamic, cursor-following gradient effect similar to Formless.xyz. The overlay provides visual depth and engagement through soft, blurred blue/green gradients that respond to mouse movement while maintaining accessibility and performance standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see a visually engaging hero section with interactive background effects, so that I feel immersed and engaged with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their cursor over the hero section THEN the background overlay SHALL display moving gradients that follow the cursor position
2. WHEN a user touches the screen on mobile devices THEN the overlay SHALL respond to touch movement with the same gradient effect
3. WHEN the overlay is active THEN it SHALL use blue and green color variations that blend smoothly
4. WHEN the overlay is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain a soft, blurred appearance with appropriate opacity to ensure text readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with motion sensitivity, I want the interactive effects to respect my accessibility preferences, so that I can comfortably view the website without motion-induced discomfort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled THEN the overlay SHALL display a static gradient without cursor-following movement
2. WHEN the overlay is present THEN it SHALL be marked with `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader interference
3. WHEN the overlay is active THEN it SHALL have `pointer-events: none` to avoid interfering with user interactions
4. WHEN text is displayed over the overlay THEN it SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility compliance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the overlay effect to be performant and well-integrated, so that it doesn't negatively impact site performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the overlay updates position THEN it SHALL use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle updates and maintain smooth performance
2. WHEN the component loads THEN it SHALL be client-side only using dynamic imports to prevent SSR issues
3. WHEN the overlay is rendering THEN it SHALL achieve performance scores â‰¥95 on Lighthouse
4. WHEN multiple cursor movements occur THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without memory leaks or performance degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer working with the brand, I want the overlay colors to be configurable through design tokens, so that the effect can be easily customized and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN overlay colors are defined THEN they SHALL use CSS custom properties or design tokens for easy customization
2. WHEN the overlay is displayed THEN it SHALL support both light and dark mode variations
3. WHEN colors are applied THEN they SHALL maintain brand consistency with existing design system
4. WHEN blend modes are used THEN they SHALL enhance rather than interfere with content readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the interactive overlay to work consistently across desktop and mobile platforms, so that I have a cohesive experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a desktop device THEN the overlay SHALL respond to mouse movement with smooth gradient positioning
2. WHEN using a mobile device THEN the overlay SHALL respond to touch events with equivalent visual feedback
3. WHEN switching between devices THEN the overlay SHALL adapt appropriately to the input method
4. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the overlay SHALL maintain proper positioning and scaling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the overlay effect to enhance rather than distract from the hero content, so that the message remains clear and impactful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text content is displayed THEN it SHALL remain fully readable with the overlay active
2. WHEN the overlay is positioned THEN it SHALL sit above the background but below the text content in the z-index stack
3. WHEN gradients are applied THEN they SHALL use appropriate opacity levels to maintain content visibility
4. WHEN the effect is active THEN it SHALL complement rather than compete with existing hero animations
