## Core Web Vitals Testing

### Overview of Core Web Vitals
Core Web Vitals are user-centric performance metrics that measure real-world user experience:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Loading performance
2. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Interactivity
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Testing

#### What LCP Measures
LCP measures when the largest content element in the viewport finishes rendering.

#### LCP Testing Procedure
```
Manual Testing Steps:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to Performance tab
3. Click record button (circle icon)
4. Reload page (Ctrl+R)
5. Stop recording after page load
6. Look for LCP marker in timeline

Automated Testing:
1. Use Lighthouse audit
2. Check PageSpeed Insights
3. Use Web Vitals Chrome extension
```

#### LCP Optimization Checklist
```
Elements that typically affect LCP:
□ Hero section heading "Ben Castillo"
□ Hero tagline text
□ Large images (if any added)
□ CSS rendering blocking
□ Font loading delays

Optimization Strategies:
□ Optimize font loading with font-display: swap
□ Minimize CSS blocking rendering
□ Use resource hints (preload, preconnect)
□ Optimize image loading (if images added)
□ Minimize server response times
```

#### LCP Testing Scenarios
```
Test Scenario 1: Fast Connection (Cable/Fiber)
1. Set Network tab to "No throttling"
2. Clear cache and reload page
3. Record LCP time
4. Target: ≤ 2.5s

Test Scenario 2: 3G Connection
1. Set Network throttling to "Fast 3G"
2. Clear cache and reload page
3. Record LCP time
4. Target: ≤ 4.0s

Test Scenario 3: Slow 3G Connection
1. Set Network throttling to "Slow 3G"
2. Clear cache and reload page
3. Record LCP time
4. Target: ≤ 6.0s
```

### FID (First Input Delay) Testing

#### What FID Measures
FID measures the delay between user's first interaction and browser's response.

#### FID Testing Procedure
```
Real User Testing (Preferred):
1. Load page completely
2. Immediately try to interact:
   - Click theme toggle button
   - Click navigation link
   - Click project filter button
3. Measure delay using DevTools

Simulated Testing:
1. Use Lighthouse audit (measures Total Blocking Time as proxy)
2. Use Performance tab to identify long tasks
3. Measure JavaScript execution time
```

#### FID Optimization Areas
```
Interactive Elements to Test:
□ Theme toggle button
□ Navigation links (About, Projects, Contact)
□ Project filter buttons
□ Contact form fields
□ Submit button

Optimization Checklist:
□ Minimize main thread blocking time
□ Split large JavaScript bundles
□ Remove unused JavaScript
□ Use code splitting for non-critical features
□ Optimize third-party script loading
```

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Testing

#### What CLS Measures
CLS measures unexpected layout shifts that occur during page load.

#### CLS Testing Procedure
```
Manual Testing:
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Enable "Web Vitals" in the rendering panel
3. Reload page and watch for layout shifts
4. Look for red bars indicating layout shifts

Visual Testing:
1. Record screen during page load
2. Watch for content jumping or shifting
3. Identify elements that cause layout shifts
```

#### CLS Optimization Checklist
```
Common CLS Causes to Check:
□ Images without dimensions
□ Fonts causing text reflow
□ Dynamic content insertion
□ CSS animations that affect layout
□ Third-party widgets

Prevention Strategies:
□ Set explicit width/height for images
□ Use font-display: swap with fallback fonts
□ Reserve space for dynamic content
□ Use transform/opacity for animations
□ Minimize third-party content
```
