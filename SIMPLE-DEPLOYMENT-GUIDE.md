# üåü Super Simple Guide: Put Your Website on the Internet!

*If you can order something on Amazon, you can do this! No technical knowledge needed.*

## What Does "Deploying" Mean? 

Right now, your website is like a Word document on your computer - only you can see it. **Deploying** means putting it on the internet so anyone can visit it by typing in a web address (like visiting Amazon.com or Facebook.com).

Think of it like this:
- **Before deploying**: Your website is a beautiful painting in your closet
- **After deploying**: Your painting is in an art gallery where everyone can see it

## üéØ Two Super Easy Options (Both 100% Free!)

I'll show you TWO ways. Pick whichever sounds easier to you:
1. **GitHub Pages** - Like uploading photos to Google Photos
2. **Vercel** - Like sharing a Google Doc

# üÜò Help! Something Doesn't Look Right

## Common Issues and Simple Fixes

### "I don't see the button you mentioned"
- **Solution:** Look for similar words. GitHub/Vercel sometimes change button names slightly
- Buttons might be different colors on your screen
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or Cmd+R)

### "It's been 20 minutes and my site isn't working"
- **GitHub Pages:**

  - Make sure it says "main" branch is selected
  - Click Save again
- **Vercel:**
  - Go to your Vercel dashboard
  - Click on your project
  - Click "Redeploy"

### "My website looks broken/weird"
- This is normal at first!
- Wait 10 more minutes - sometimes files take time to load
- Try opening it in a different browser
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### "I got an error message"
- **Don't panic!** Take a screenshot
- Most errors fix themselves if you:
  - Wait 5 minutes
  - Refresh the page
  - Try clicking Deploy/Save again

### "I'm completely lost"
- **That's okay!** This stuff can be confusing
- Take a break and try again later
